  <h1>Research Interests</h1>

  <p>My primary research lies at the intersection of computer science and physics. I am particularly interested in:</p>

  - Machine learning for scientific discovery (physics-informed ML, symmetries, equivariance)
  - Scalable simulation and surrogate modeling (reduced-order models, neural surrogates)
  - Probabilistic methods and uncertainty quantification
  - High-performance computing & distributed training for large scientific models

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Physics-aware generative models for simulation acceleration — short description.</li>
    <li>Interpretable ML pipelines for experimental data analysis.</li>
  </ul>
